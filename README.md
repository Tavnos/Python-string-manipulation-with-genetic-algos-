# Python-string-manipulation-with-genetic-algos-
Originally inspired from Daniel Shiffman in his "Nature of Code" which was a P5 processing javascript project, Genetic algorithms has paved the ground for today's neural network. I am currently still working on this and enjoying it quite a lot, let me know what you think :D
