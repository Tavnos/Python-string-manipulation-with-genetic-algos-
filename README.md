# Python-string-manipulation-with-genetic-algos-
Originally inspired from Daniel Shiffman in his "Nature of Code" which was a P5 processing javascript project, Genetic algorithms has paved the ground for today's neural network. As i am writing this, i just included the "shatter" (cross breed selection between quart cromosomial genotypes) and "radiate" (point accepted mutation, where radiation enables nucleotic chromosomial changes ;)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_accepted_mutation) i now feel done with my milestone, yet i may come back to this :D
if you had some fun and/or glory from this, let me know ^^
